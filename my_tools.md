I have many tools which easy my work (almost) everyday, here are a few of them.
I'll promise I'll update if a new toy comes to the playground!

## My IDE

- üß∞ My IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### üìì and its Extensions

- üîç Better highlight the errors and warnings [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

- My Shell config is always up to date in in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles) repo, but here is a quick rundown:

  - On Windows I use [PowerShell v7](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73378788/8552476) in [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), with a customized theme
  - On Ubuntu I use [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), also with some [touched settings](https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/fish)

## Terminal Apps

As for the CLI tools, if available, I prefer tools developed in Rust, because usually runs in every OS flawlessly, nonetheless I also have many others:

- `pipx` for the global tools in python (`black`, `flake8`, `pipenv`, `mypy`, `pre-commit`, `all-repos`, etc).
- [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is amazing.
- I use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager a lot.
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is your faster, better, stronger grep (and runs in Windows!)
- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) a modern replacement for `ls`. (Works on linux tho). (Works only on linux tho)
- [`fnm` (fast NodeJS Manager)](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is a NodeJS version manager written in Rust. Yes, you need that.
- For Windows PowerShell I use [Terminal-Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons)

- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) a cat clone, but better.
