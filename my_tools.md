I have many tools which easy my work (almost) everyday, here are a few of them.
I'll promise I'll update if a new toy comes to the playground!

- üß∞ My IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

üìì Extensions

- üñåÔ∏è Theme: [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple)
  ![img](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657642760203/rGiW18dDd.png?auto=compress)
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Vim shorcuts (a MUST have!) : [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/vscodevim)
- ‚è≤Ô∏è Track your time while you develop: [WakaTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime)
- üîç Better highlight the errors and warnings [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

- My Shell config is always up to date in in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles) repo, but here is a quick rundown:

  - On Windows I use [PowerShell v7](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73378788/8552476) in [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), with a customized theme
  - On Ubuntu I use [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), also with some [touched settings](https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/fish)

- I really like tools developed in Rust, because usually runs in every OS flawlessly, here are a couple I love:

  - [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is your faster, better, stronger grep (and runs in Windows!)
  - [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) a modern replacement for `ls`. (Works on linux tho)(https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/fish . ()Works on linuxPolinux tho)
  - [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) a cat clone, but better.

- Other stuff
  - [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is amazing.
  - I use [choloatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager a lot.
