I have many tools I use almost everyday, here are a few of them. I'll promise I'll update the post if a new toy comes to the playground.

- My IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  Extensions:

  - Theme: [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple)

  - Must have Vim shorcuts: [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/vscodevim)
  - Track your time while you develop: [WakaTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime)
  - Better highligt the errors and warnings [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

- My Shell config is uploaded in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/AucaCoyan/dotfiles) but here is a quick rundown:

  - On Windows I use PowerShell in Windows Terminal, with a customized theme
  - On Ubuntu I use Fish shell, also with some touched settings

- I really like tools developed in Rust, because usually runs in every OS flawlessly, here are a couple I love:

  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is your faster, better, stronger grep (and in Windows!)
  - [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) a modern replacement for `ls`
  - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) a cat clone, but better.

- Other stuff
  - [github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is amazing
