Javascript is certainly the most hated programming language, but nonetheless it's by far the most used on the web. Here are my notes.

# Javascript section

Empty for the time being

# NodeJS / `npm` section

## What is the `@` when you install packages?

Like:

```sh
npm install @angular/router
```

They are called 'scoped packages'. It's a fancy way to teams and enterprises to have namespaces so they control whats after the `@name/...` thing
