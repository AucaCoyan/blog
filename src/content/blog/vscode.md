VS code is one of my favorites editors. With the years I gather a few tips I can pass on to you:

# Tasks are great

Allison Thackston has a great article about [tasks in VSCode](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode-tasks.html)

# Let VSCode help you with problem matchers

[This](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode-tasks-problemmatcher.html) article explains really well what is a problem matcher. You should try it out!

For more advanced uses, go to the [VSCode reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-multiline-problem-matcher)
