![first of all](https://preview.redd.it/916ijspl5zr11.gif?format=mp4&s=d62e20e7309f7440edb0a323f10509169da66110)

From the beginning, I have always wanted to share the things I wish I had known earlier in my coding journey. Finding resources and support can be challenging, and this is why I decided to start my own blog.

I was inspired by an [insightful post on `mypy`](https://sadh.life/post/mypy-guide/), which led me [to another post](https://sadh.life/post/write-a-blog/) about the importance of taking notes. This convinced me to create my own platform.

Here's what you can expect to find on my blog:

## 1. Uploading my personal notes

I compile notes from various sources such as online courses, StackOverflow searches, TikTok tips, YouTube shorts, and other useful ideas I come across.

## 2. Expressing my beliefs on improving content creation

I believe in making coding more accessible, especially for newcomers. When I began my coding journey, I encountered numerous unfamiliar terms. Even after searching for explanations, it often became overwhelming. I want to foster a community that welcomes beginners and makes them feel at ease rather than confused.

## 3. Sharing valuable hints and resources

I aim to pass down useful knowledge to others. This includes sharing low-count star repositories on GitHub that solve common and overlooked problems. Additionally, I will provide tips and tricks using popular tools like `git` and the shell.

By creating this coding blog, I hope to contribute to the programming community and make the coding journey a little smoother for everyone.
