We've all been with a recently bought pc or formatted away from the point of disaster and the need to install every single piece of software is a bummer.

It's fun at the beginning, I could say, but when a few hours or days are gone it happens that you remember "ah! I need this application too!" over and over again.

Luckily for us, the terminal can our friend and bulk install a big bunch of software. You can do this with a couple of options:

# Option 1: (windows only) Winget

[Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) is a CLI app from Microsoft. You can also check for apps in API for viewing packages [wingetdotrun](https://github.com/winget-run/wingetdotrun) at http://winget.run

Speaking of a terminal app that can install applications, you can follow [this guide](https://4sysops.com/archives/winget-install-multiple-apps/) to batch install a bunch of software.

# Option 2: (windows only, I think ðŸ¤”) `chocolatey`

Same as Winget, you can do the same with chocolatey. Another CLI app.
