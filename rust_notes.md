### Rust

The core features of rust are:

- Performance
- Reliability
- Productivity

### Learning resources

As always, I will leave here my 2 cents in the crazy big book called the world wild web.

- [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP) has an amazing playlist explaining concepts from the beginning and getting you excited to learn rust. You can't stop binge watching!
- [This other post by Brandon Smith](https://www.brandons.me/blog/why-rust-strings-seem-hard) talks about strings in rust. For devs coming from every popular languages except C or C++, strings are easy to work with. By comparison, strings in rust are a tough cookie.

### How do _I_ learn rust?

I saw the entire playlist of **No Boilerplate**, just get my feet warm and then with codewars, start to resolve simple katas an learn as I go.

If you are curious about my advance. [Here](http://github.com/AucaCoyan/exp-rust) is the repository on github.
