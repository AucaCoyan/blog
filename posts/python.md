Python is my most studied programming language, so I new a few things here and there. Here are my notes:

# Interesting things

- [PrettyErrors](https://github.com/onelivesleft/PrettyErrors) turns Exceptions into a beautiful poem.
- [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/) is a colorful REPL for python. Unfortunately only works for POSIX systems

# tips and tricks

I have loads of tips and tricks. I will try to jot them down as I remember all of them:

```python
# if you put a variable and = after that
print(f'{str_value = }')
# prints the var and its value
# str_value = 'the contents of my variable'
```
