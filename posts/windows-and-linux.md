# Windows and linux

This is a very hot topic, specially among developers, so take all this with the objetivity a human can possibly have.



...

Let's address the many elefants on the room (or it should be a house, I don't know)

## * The world use both windows and linux

And it won't change anytime soon.
The servers are all in unix systems
Windows reigns on residential pcs and many workplaces. Many times you are "confined" because of a certain app (say, Adobe, or because your work don't want you to use linux with the VPN.


## We should adapt 

In the past we use the earliest versions of iOS and Android to see desktop sites, now the vast majority of websites are designed to both mobile and desktop platforms (and tablets too!). We should adapt and design software that garantees to run on every major OS. Yeah, we can't assure support for every single OS out there, but at least with UNIX and Windows we can rest assure we support most of them.
