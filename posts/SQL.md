# SQL

SQL (pronounced 'see-qwel') is the currently most famous database language. As I need to learn it deeply in my current job, here are my side notes:

# Don't waste time with SQL Server

[Azure Data Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio) is WAY better in terms of interface. If you are familiar with VS Code, it is a really close user experience.

# SQL Linters and formatters

- Azure Data Studio has one called `mssql`
- and browsing on the web I found [`sqlfluff`](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/) which is a python package to lint many SQL problems in general.
- If you prefer an online formtatter, here is one oldie but goodie: [SQLLint](https://github.com/mikoskinen/SQLLint). And its site [http://sqllint.com/](http://sqllint.com/)
