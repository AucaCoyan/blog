I always wanted to communicate the things I wish I knew before. The coding journey may be long and even harder than it is already if you don't find resources to help you.
Speaking of those, the internet is full of blogs, especially coding blogs, so why am I doing this?

I was inspired by this [excellent `mypy` post](https://sadh.life/post/mypy-guide/), in which blog [this other post talking about taking notes](https://sadh.life/post/write-a-blog/) convinced me to start my own.

Here below you will find what you will read here:

## first and foremost, to have my notes uploaded to the web.

I take notes on the courses, stackoverflow searches, tips I see in TikTok, shorts of YouTube, and simple good ideas I find in general.

## next in line, to express my beliefs about how we can all produce content in a better way (especially welcoming for newcomers!)

As I started to code, I read loads and loads of terms that I didn't understood. And even if had the patiences of I googling down the rabbit hole, most of the time it gets worse and worse for every term you search.

I would like the community of programmers to make other newbies feel at home, rather than dizzy about what is going on and think that they are the problem.

## lastly, to pass down really useful hints.

That low-count start repo on github that solves a really common and unaddressed problem, or these the magic recipes with the tools everybody use, like `git`, `shell` and such.
