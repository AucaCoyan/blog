## My personal blog

I use [ðŸ“¦`pnpm`](pnpm.io/) for packaging the NPM modules.
First, install the packages

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development view

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port indicated by the CLI) with your browser to see the result.
